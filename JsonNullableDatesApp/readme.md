# About

This project is an exercise in working with ChatGPT to see if it can create JSON converters for DateOnly and DateTime, where dates could have a null or an odd format. I started by reading the following [post](https://www.conradakunga.com/blog/writing-a-custom-dateonly-json-deserializer/).

In both cases, ChatGPT took an initial prompt followed by several follow-up questions, and in cases used Copilot on failed ChatGPT solutions.
